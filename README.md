# Job Matching App

This Job Matching App helps users assess how well their resume matches various job descriptions. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, it calculates a similarity score between a user's resume and job descriptions to provide suggestions on how to improve the match. This app is built with [Gradio](https://gradio.app) for a simple and interactive web interface, and it utilizes Hugging Face's `sentence-transformers` library to measure the similarity.

## Features
- **Upload Resume**: Allows users to paste or upload their resume text.
- **Upload Job Descriptions CSV**: Accepts a CSV file of job descriptions (scraped from LinkedIn or other platforms).
- **Similarity Score**: Calculates a similarity score between the resume and each job description.
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Provides recommendations on relevant keywords that could improve the resume.

## Project Structure
- `app.py`: Main application file for the Gradio interface.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies needed to run the app.
- `README.md`: Documentation for setting up and using the app.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Git installed
- Git LFS (Large File Storage) installed

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git lfs install  # Initialize Git LFS if you haven't already
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/jobmatching.git
cd jobmatching
```

### Install Dependencies

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. To set up:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
# For Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the App

To start the Gradio app, run:

```bash
python app.py
```

After running this command, you should see a Gradio link in your terminal. Open the link in your browser to access the Job Matching App.

## Usage

1. **Upload Resume Text**: Paste or upload your resume in the provided text box.
2. **Upload Job Descriptions CSV**: Upload a CSV file containing job descriptions. The CSV should have columns like `title`, `company`, and `description`.
3. **View Results**: The app will display the top matching jobs along with similarity scores and suggestions for improvement.

## Example CSV Format

The CSV file should have the following columns:

| title                | company             | description                                    |
|----------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Data Scientist       | Example Corp        | Experience with machine learning, Python, etc. |
| Senior Data Analyst  | Data Inc            | Requires SQL, Python, data visualization...    |

## How It Works
1. **Similarity Calculation**: Uses the `sentence-transformers` model from Hugging Face to encode both the resume and job descriptions into vector embeddings, which are then compared for similarity.
2. **Keyword Extraction**: Analyzes keywords from each job description and compares them to those in the resume.
3. **Suggestions**: Identifies missing relevant keywords that can enhance the resume's alignment with the job requirements.

## Technology Stack
- **Gradio**: For creating a user-friendly web interface.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For encoding job descriptions and resume text into embeddings.
- **Python Libraries**: `pandas` for handling CSV data, `sentence-transformers` for similarity calculation, and `sklearn` for keyword extraction.
